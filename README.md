## BayesOpGAN

BayesOpGAN offers a generative adversarial network for 1D data generation. The network incorporates BayesOpLoss to generate higher-fidelity 1D data and provides a Fourier Distance Tool to measure the authenticity of generated data.

## Dataset
All datasets are available in RRUFF https://rruff.info/

## Usage
### Generate synthetic data
```python
python bayesopgan.py
```
### Measure the generated data with Fourier Distance Tool

```python
python fourier_tool.py
```
