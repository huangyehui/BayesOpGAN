## BayesOpGAN

BayesOpGAN offers a generative adversarial network for 1D data generation. The network incorporates BayesOpLoss to generate higher-fidelity 1D data and provides a Fourier Distance Tool to measure the authenticity of generated data.

## Dataset
All datasets are available in RRUFF https://rruff.info/

## Usage
### Generate synthetic data
```python
python bayesopgan.py
```
### Measure the generated data with Fourier Distance Tool

```python
python fourier_tool.py
```

## Results
Comparison between the generated and real Raman spectra of the mineral Beryl. (a) Representative Raman spectra generated by BayesOpGAN and the corresponding box plots of five characteristic peaks (n = 26); (b) Interpolated Raman spectra from the original Excellent_Unoriented dataset (RRUFF) and their box plots of the same five characteristic peaks (n = 26).

## How to evaluate the qulity of generated Spectra

We propose Fourier Distance to evaluate it:

$$
D_{\text{Fourier}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \bar{D}_{\text{KL}}^{(i)} = \frac{1}{NM} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{M} D_{\text{KL}}(P_s^{(i)} \| P_r^{(j)})
$$
